# Sample memory dumps

This directory contains sample memory dumps of the relevant memory region
of [whoopsie](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/whoopsie)
during the PoC described in
[README_CVE-2019-15790](../README_CVE-2019-15790.md).
As I mention in "Explanatory Notes" section, I have found that the offset of
the magazine chunk is consistently `0x6f40` when I am in the office and `0x7040`
when I am at home (same laptop, different locations).
So the files in this directory are named "home" and "work" to show this pattern.
